# Terminal and Finder

- Before we can talk about scripts we have to talk about the shell in general
- Open terminal, we are in a shell
- basic REPL - read-eval-print-loop
- unix philosophy with output - or lack thereof
- `cd ~/Desktop; mkdir foo; open foo`
- Open finder, move to the same directory
- directories ARE folders
- create some files, touch file.txt
- vim it
- cat it
- echo hi > it
- rm it
