# Editing a file in the terminal (vim crash course)

- We're gonna use `vim` - don't be scared!
- `vim file.txt`
  - press `i` - basic stuff, esc-:wq
- reinforce `less`, `grep`, to show it's still just a file
- talk about modes - make video game analogy (game play vs. menu)
- `vim script.sh`
  - explain `.sh` and talk about extensions in general
- (ignore shebang for now)
- basic script like `echo hello $USER`
- `bash script.sh`
- mess around with the script a bit
- `date`
- `now=$(date)`
