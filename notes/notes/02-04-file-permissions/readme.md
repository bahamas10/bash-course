# File Permissions

- do we need to run `bash`?
  - compare to how we run `users` or `ls` directly
- can we just run `script.sh`
- try `./script.sh`
- `chmod +x script.sh`
- `./script.sh` # why does this work??
- mention shebangs, link to video
- `stat script.sh`
- `stat /usr/bin/ls`
- `ls -lha .`
- explain users, group, world
- `chown`, `chmod`, `chgrp`
