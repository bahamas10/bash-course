# Paging Files

- `cat /usr/share/dict/words`
- it's a big file and annoying let's do this
- `less /usr/share/dict/words`
- teach less
- `cat /usr... | less`
- `cat ... | grep | less`
- `man less`
- search with /
- also show `more`
- ls -1i /usr/bin/more /usr/bin/less (less is more)
- `less file.txt`
- `cat file.txt | less`
