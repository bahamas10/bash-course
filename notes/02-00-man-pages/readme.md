# Man Pages

- show basic examples
- `man man` - this is a fun one
- talk about sections
- when you run without a section name it assumes 1 (and works its way up)
- commands exist on your system
- `man cp`, `man mkdir`, etc.
- `man history` doesn't quit work?
- some commands are builtin to the shell (bash)
- bash has `help`
- `help history`
- `help help`
- `compgen -b` will list all builtins
- `compgen -b | grep | less` # all of this stuff is the same!!
- `compgen -b > builtins.txt`
- `history | ... | ...` # because history is builtin!
