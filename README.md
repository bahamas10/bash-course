High-level Overview

### What it is

A long video, broken into chapters, that will live on YouTube for free.  Any
supplemental material for it will live on GitHub in a repo specific to this
course.

Example: 6 hour video total, 20 minute sections = 18 chapters
 - upload as 1 big video
 - also upload as 18 smaller videos in a playlist

### Who it's for

The absolute beginner and the person who wants to look inside bash.c - and
everyone in between.

0-100%: from absolute beginner to proficient and comfortable on a CLI only
interface.

100%+: dig into the source code, look at how things are implemented, complex
data structures in bash - basically how to think of bash as a programming
language more than a scripting language.

0-100% = 85-90% of the course
100%+ = remaining 10-15% of the course - think of it as DLC

### What you'll learn

What a terminal is, how it interacts with your system, and how you can see that
through finder/explorer/file manager/etc. (show the CLI interacting with GUI).

What a shell is (fundamentally a REPL) and how we can interact with it via
commands (external and builtin).

Basic filesystem manipulation commands and visual (GUI) realtime representation
of the work being done. (create, delete, list files - maybe even convert a webp
to jpg).

Basic task automations with scripts - how to take a series of commands and run
them all at once.

Complex task automations with scripts - introduce conditional branching, string
manipulation.

Finally, feel proficient in a CLI environment - be able to edit files (nano,
vim) and rename files in batches. (example mismatch of .jpg and .JPG files -
normalize them).

### What you need

A computer with a terminal emulator:
- Mac with terminal.app (show a little iterm and bash)
- Linux with a terminal
- Windows with WSL (figure out how to help people with this)

No real prior knowledge - try to start from the ground up.
